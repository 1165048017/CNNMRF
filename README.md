# CNNMRF
This is the code for paper "Combining Markov Random Fields and Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Synthesis"

This algorithm can be used for

1) un-guided image synthesis (for example, classical texture synthesis)

2) guided image synthesis (for example, transfer the style between different images)
